# Location Geodeoding

## Introduction

This project offers a simple yet effective way to retrieve geocoding information, including latitude, longitude, and formatted address, for a given location. It utilizes the Google Places API or a default service URL to perform the geocoding process. The script is designed to assist users in obtaining precise geographic coordinates for various locations effortlessly.

## Features and Functionality

- **Address Input**: Users can input the location address they want to geocode.
- **Google Places API or Default Service**: The script checks for a Google Places API key; if not available, it defaults to a provided service URL.
- **HTTP Request Handling**: Utilizes `urllib` to handle HTTP requests for obtaining geocoding data.
- **JSON Data Parsing**: The script uses the `json` library to parse the received JSON response and extract the necessary geocoding details.
- **Error Handling**: It includes error handling to manage potential issues with data retrieval or malformed responses.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Internet connectivity to access the geocoding service/API

## Conclusion

This Python Location Geocoding script provides a quick and straightforward way to fetch geocoding details for various locations. It offers a basic implementation that can be expanded upon or integrated into larger projects requiring geographic data.
